# Deforestation in Guinea-Bissau

## Introduction
Guinea-Bissau is a small west African country that has seen a significant increase in forest loss around the year 2012. 
Guinea-Bissau became known as Africa's first 'Narco-state' in 2005 after several high level military and political figures have
been arrested at implicated in drug trafficking. This project will focus on visually representing this forest loss with a 
focus on highlighting the years the Guinea-Bissau functioned as a narco-state and the landscpae transformations associated with
this illicit activity.

## Data
Using the Hansen Global Forest Loss dataset provides a 30m resolution of forest loss across the global since 2000. Using this 
dataset within Google Earth Engine multi-temporal analysis can quickly be performed. 

## Methods

[Here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/4e5dc5ac9be55b813aae3ac6ee2dfc4b) is a link to the code used to create this preliminary analysis
